# submits jobs to the cluster using list of hyperparameters in the params.csv file. In detail, it does the following:
# - updates the status of the jobs by removing lines that were successfully completed (status DONE) for
# files params.csv and exit.log.
# NOTE: it uses the bjobs -a command to see what jobs were successfully finished with the exit status DONE
# However, since this information is only shown for the jobs within the last 1 hour, in order to maintain the parameters list correctly,
# this script must run at least every 1 hour
# - updates the status of the jobs by adding jobids that failed to exit.log
# - goes through line by line in params.csv, submits job if it’s not a failed job until the number of submitted jobs becomes N_JOBS_MAX_NORMAL. update the job id and submission count in params.csv
# - goes through line by line in params.csv, submits job if it’s a failed job until the number of submitted jobs becomes N_JOBS_MAX_EXIT. update the job id and submission count

# two queues exist: the cluster queue and the parameters queue. 
# for job submission to the cluster I term it enqueue for the cluster, 
# and adding new sets of hyperparameters to params.csv I term it enqueue for the parameters.
# cron job is used to run enqueue_cluster.sh periodically
